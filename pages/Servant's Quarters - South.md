- Servants' Quarters - South
  When Hendrik Dewulf left behind the life of a mercenary, he appointed his quartermaster as head of his new household. This would have drawn little comment, except that his quartermaster was a woman - the soft-spoken, steely-willed Ernestine Peterhans. For more than five decades, these rooms were her unchallenged domain. Even in her eightieth year, she still walked her rounds every day, and the servants would fall silent at the distant jingle of her keys.
