  "Kingsluck pie" - a beef pie with pears and cinnamon and secret ingredients - is the traditional dish of the House. It was first cooked, they say, for King Henry, when in great secrecy on St Piran's Day he came to Cornwall seeking the 'King's Metal', tin, to 'restore his Alloy'. It probably didn't happen. But the pie did.
