- Sand-Scarred Journal
- I am the Librarian of Hush House, and this journal will record what arose from my Crime and my Curse. [The Archaeologist's dearest wish, when they came to the House, was to record a History where their crime could be forgiven... or redefined. But you can complete the game by recording any History. You might wish to begin your studies with the Skolekosophy Wisdom.]
