- Skin of Silver
- The epic of the final battle of the Lionsmith with the remnant-giant Antaios.
- I've Read...
- The Lionsmith beseeches the Three for their assistance, and the Meniscate favours him with a skin of silver, like water, like mercury, so he too can drink power from the Moon; for, she whispers, he too will one day be drawn into a perfect balance.
- I'm Reading...
- As always, the Lionsmith drew his strength from metal, and Antaios from stoneï¿½ but the Lionsmith began to suspect also that this time, Antaios was drawing power from the Moon.
