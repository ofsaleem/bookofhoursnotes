- Witchworms
- Tiny larvae with half-human faces. Fortunately, they rarely develop into their imago stage; but even as larvae, their whispering can torment senses and distort thoughts. [These can affect your Shapt and Wist, and spread to nearby objects. You can remove them with a skill that's effective against Infestations, and at least 7 Winter.]
