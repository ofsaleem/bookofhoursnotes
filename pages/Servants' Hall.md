- Servants' Hall
  Hendrik Dewulf, 1st Baron Brancrug, was granted Hush House after the dissolution of St Brandan's by 'Old Coppernose', King Henry VIII. In an act of unusual generosity for that tight-fisted King, the grant came with the title of Baron, and rights <i>sicut regale</i> - 'like a king', the quasi-independence traditionally accorded to Marcher Lords. Hendrik was clearly determined to live as befitted his new rank, and he expanded the house accordingly to support sufficient staff.
