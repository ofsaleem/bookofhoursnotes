- The Locksmith's Dream: Stolen Reflections
  The fourth volume of Teresa Galmier's expansive work - no longer a discussion of the dreams of artisans, but a valuable survey of other works. The tone is calmer than that of 'Trespasses', but occasionally fearful, even paranoid. This volume was published in 1926 but almost immediately recalled and pulped by the publisher - at the request of the author or possibly the authorities, depending which story you believe. A few copies survive.

  Janus has, they say, not one face but two. To which I reply: why only one? Why only two? Hersault and Coseley - according to Thomas Love Denman - once agreed that Janus was 'all the gods and none'. But later, Hersault described him as 'all the gods', and Coseley favoured 'none'. Denman was a sinister dilettante, but this rings true of them both.'

- Janus is the Gatekeeper, the twin-god, the god that wounds, the presager of changes, the sun, the moon. So we identify him with the Watchman, the Twins, with the Mother, with the Forge, with the Meniscate and the Madrugad. He cannot be all these. Can he? The flamines knew the Church, knew the Dry Land, knew Elagabalus. Is he then synthesis? Or is he something else? In Gallaecia they called him Ianus Lamius, but the Obliviates are notorious for their slanders.'
