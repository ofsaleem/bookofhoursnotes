- In the Malleary
- A lively account of the creation of each jewel at the world's beginning.
- I've Read...
  The author is either terribly misinformed of the nature of the Hours, or - one begins to suspect - intentionally throwing up a smoke-screen to confuse seekers of the Invisible Arts. But there are some useful crumbs of fact to be picked out of the daft and gaping cracks.
- I'm Reading...
- Lively, yes; but also almost entirely nonsense. 'Pearl, the tears of the forgotten moon, caught by the Lionsmith in his net. Ruby, the blood of the first bird, stung by the Lionsmith's hammer.'
