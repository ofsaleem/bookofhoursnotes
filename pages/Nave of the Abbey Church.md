- Nave of the Abbey Church
  For a thousand years the Unconquered Sun has been worshipped here in all his Aspects - though since the heresies of the Intercalate, many of those aspects are considered distinct Hours in their own right, and the Sun's death and birth are both now celebrated.
- The Abbey Church used to be more golden, but many of the valuables were lost at the Abbey's dissolution, including the original stained glass. These magnificent windows are of recent manufacture, financed by the eighth Librarian, Greene, who was a believer of the Second Dawn variety.
