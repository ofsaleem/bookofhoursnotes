- Patients' Lounge
  In this room, the accursed of the Great War gathered to recuperate - those who had suffered something no more horrible, but somewhat more mysterious, than the War's usual wounds to body and spirit - an irruption of Worms, perhaps, or the risks at the military end of Suppression Bureau activities. Among them were minor luminaries of the invisible world - Christopher Illopoly, Zachary Wakefield, Harvey Hattington. But not Brian Levinsen, who had been ninth Librarian, and under whose tenure the Infirmary had flourished. He enlisted; he served for a time as a medical officer on the Western Front; his body was never found.
