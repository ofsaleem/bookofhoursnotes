- Atrium
  In 1651, Musgrave Dewulf endowed the atrium with a shrine to St Januarius of the Gate. Musgrave was a pious man but also a Puritan, so this grand shrine was a little unusual. St Januarius is also an unusual choice - but he is the patron saint of boundaries, and the Dewulfs were often said in some sense to be 'Marcher Lords' charged with the keeping of boundaries.
