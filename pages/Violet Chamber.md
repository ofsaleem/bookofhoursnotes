- Violet Chamber
- In the days of the Dewulfs, this chamber was reserved for the lady of the House. Later, the Librarians Willem Harries and Gervinus van Lauren both preferred it to the Librarian's Quarters. Harries  established a little shrine to St Agnes in the far corner, and there it remained for many years until van Lauren ordered it to be removed.
