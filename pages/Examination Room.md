- Examination Room
  Hendrik Dewulf evicted the family of the healer Natan from the Barber's Tower - as it was then called. ('I have rooted out the barber's brood,' he is recorded to have gloated.) But his great-great-grandson Gideon - 'the Motley Baron', for his brindled hair - restored the Tower and made it a place of healing again.
  Of course the equipment in this room dates from the current century. But Gideon's other nickname was 'the Cutter'. It was rumoured that he bought corpses for dissection - even that he was a vivisectionist. The latter was probably a slander, but one way or another, scholars have been cutting up corpses in here for a very long time.
