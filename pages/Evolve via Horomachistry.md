- Evolve via Horomachistry
- I could use Horomachistry with this to evolve my Soul. [Once you've committed a skill to the Horomachistry Wisdom, you can use that skill with this to combine two identical Soul cards into a greater one. But you must use a skill you've attuned to that Wisdom, and the attunement will only work once.]
