- Duelling Hall
- In Baronial times, this was a ballroom, but in the nineteenth century, during Brulleau's time as Librarian, a dyad of eternally duelling Edge-long agreed to stay at Hush House for a year and a day to allow Natalia to study them, if she satisfied certain conditions. A properly equipped space was one of those conditions. (Ultimately, the business turned out to be a trap or trick played by one or both of the dyad, and they left after only a single battle.) Their names are recorded as 'Mistress Dearday' and 'Father Torgue'.
