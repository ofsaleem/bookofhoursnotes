- On Matthias and the Amethyst Imago: Pursuit
  An account of an occult romance. A certain Mek claims to have written this in a single night as part of his initiation into the Theban branch of the House of Lethe - that order of immortals who used the arts of water to conceal themselves.

- Matthias loved the Imago. (Did he? Can Long love, or has that organ of their soul desiccated beyond repair?) The Imago loved Matthias. (Did she? or did she only enact a whim?) He pursued her through the Wood, but at the last she turned aside from the nightmare-slough, and they lay together where the Bounds grow bright. So they learnt the Grail's pleasures, and this is the lore they won.'

- 'Matthias defied us to hunt the Names of the Moth in the Wood, to populate his pinned collection. The Amethyst Imago had dallied with the Witch-and-Sister, but she'd returned to the Wood to plead the Moth's pardon. The Moth, as a whim or a penance, sent her out to lure the Long to a slough of nightmares.
