- Church Tower
- The bells in this tower  rang every Sunday, even in Solomon Husher's time, until Thirza Blake finally cancelled services so she could save money by sacking the priest. This brought a deputation of angry locals from Brancrug Village, where there was a fearful superstition that when the bells of Brancrug fell silent, the bells of Ys would be heard.
