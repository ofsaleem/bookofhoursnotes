  Lord Franklin Bancroft, sometimes called the Prince of Wines, begins a series of visits to Brancrug House. His relationship with Eva becomes a source of scandal. Eva is by now forty-nine, but rumours persist for years of a Dewulf-Bancroft heir. Eva's biographer claims that before her 'drowning death', her child by Bancroft was adopted by her friends the Southeys - that the child became the sister of the later Poet Laureate, Robert Southey. (No real evidence is provided in support of this claim.)

These include a waxed pouch containing a letter addressed to Wheelock, whose contents seem to show he is a spy in the pay of the Austrians. Subsequent investigations suggest that the letter is a forgery, but the matter remains obscure...
