- The Alloy of the White Rose
- An account by 'Mistress White-Flower' of the alchemical techniques favoured by the House of York, also identified with the 'Dawn Road'. These techniques failed to bring them victory in the War of the Roads, but are 'not to be discounted'.

- 'Mistress White-Flower' urges a 'History of Uzult', where the Second Dawn may come to pass. She identifies Xanthotic Essence as Uzult's predecessor; she explains that with sufficient Lantern, Bitterblack Salts can be Purified to Xanthotic Essence, and Iotic Essence can be Exalted to Xanthotic Essence.

- The author asserts proudly that the Dawn Road ends in the Second Dawn; and hints darkly that the downfall of the House of York was 'Grail-sabotage'.
