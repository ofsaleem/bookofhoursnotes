- Radiant Stair
  The Watchman's shrine here is decorated with the Eye Elagabaline - a controversial variant of the Watchman's Eye. The Elagabaline rites have always had a shaky doctrinal status. It would not often have been seen, of course. These stairs were reserved for the choir monks who sang the liturgy of the Hours, the only ones permitted to enter the Chancel. Still, it is a little surprising that the Eye was allowed to remain, when the monastery was dissolved and the Isle given to the Dewulfs.
