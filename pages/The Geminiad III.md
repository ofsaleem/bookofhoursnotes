- The Geminiad iii
  A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the moon. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - Fucine - is much older. Coral decorates its cover, and its page-edges are sharp enough to slash a throat.
