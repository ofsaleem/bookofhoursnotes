- The Hymn of the Phases celebrates the Meniscate 'from whom we do not turn', for the truth which is beauty, the beauty which is truth, and the perfect balance between the two.

  The hymns venerate every sanctioned Hour, celebrating them as the Sun Undivided, but also suggesting that each Hour may <i>become</i> the next - Madrugad to Watchman, Watchman to Wolf, and so on.
