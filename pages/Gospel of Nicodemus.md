- An apocryphal account of the works and experiences of the Shepherd Illuminate by one of his supposed companions.
- I've Read...
- The Shepherd Illuminate, the Virgin-Born, warns of the Sun's Division but promises its ultimate reunification in the Second Dawn 'through the ministry of St Uzult'. <i>Uzult</i> is of course the ink of power used by Librarians of the Tree, but also venerated as a saint in some borderline heterodox solar traditions.

  'Inventori Lucis Soli Invicto Nuntio' reads the dedication - loosely translatable as 'I am the herald of the Sun Unconquerable, Light's Contriver'. This is a variation on the more usual 'invicto augusto', the declaration which united the eastern and western traditions of the Church Solar.
