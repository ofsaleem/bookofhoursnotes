- The Queen's Turn
  A sixteenth-century translation of the Barrowchild's account of 'Lagiah's Turn' - when Lagiah, the Queen Unsated, was offered the opportunity to enter the service of the Hours of the Triple Knot, as long as she repudiated her brother-lover Antaios.

  The traditions described here - the ones generally described as 'Hill and Hollow' - are associated with Lagiah before her Turn; but now that she's a Name of the Red Grail, they might also be safely used before an altar of the Triple Knot.

  Lagiah accepts, setting aside 'the arts of the low red sun' associated with Antaios. She bargains, however, for freedom for her daughters. The Hours of the Triple Knot accept casually, knowing that Lagiah has devoured her daughters - but wily Lagiah has decided, 'in the secret hollow of her heart', that she will adopt any who ask, if they can prove their fierceness.
