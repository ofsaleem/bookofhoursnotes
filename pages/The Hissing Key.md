- The Hissing Key
- An account of the ascent of the Hour called the Mother of Ants, by the Bosk-scholar Mek, of the Theban branch of the House of Lethe.
- I've Read...
- The Milk-Thief conspires with the Ligeian Echidna and the Hour-to-be called Chiliarch (now more generally rendered as 'Colonel') to unseam the Seven-Coils with feathers and drown her in salt. The Colonel thus ascends to Hour status; the jealous Milk-Thief, once the Colonel's priestess, seduces Echidna into lending her the Hissing Key to enter the Mansus through the Savage Door, beginning her own ascent to Name and ultimately Hour.
- I'm Reading...
- Mek is not sympathetic to the Mother of Ants, who he calls 'the Milk-Thief'. He reviles her for her part in the death of the Seven-Coils, which he presents as a treacherous conspiracy.
