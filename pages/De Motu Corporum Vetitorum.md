- Hubris declares that the Great Comet of 1577 was the physical embodiment of the Hour named Madrugad; that It disintegrated but its fragments gravitate to bone-marrow, where they can be located even now. He insists that Ouranoscopic techniques can be used with Essential Periost and sufficient Sky to create a 'talisman gerifugic'.

- Hubris's thesis: that stars, planets and other bodies are the proxies or even essences of the Hours, and that conjunctions and occlusions reveal the outcome of Hour-intrigues in the Mansus.
