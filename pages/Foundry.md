- Foundry
- This room was set aside for metalworking by Hendrik Dewulf. There's always been a smithy in Brancrug Village, but Hendrik wanted to make sure he could have his pistol-balls cast and his prisoner-shackles mended, even if the villagers were feeling rebellious. When Ambrose Westcott arrived, he had little use for shackles and less for pistols; he refurbished the place for his metallurgical experiments. A bad place to be in summer, a good one in winter.
