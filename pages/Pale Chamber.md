- Pale Chamber
- In the time of the Dewulfs, this magnificent bedroom was reserved for the Baron... or in Lady Eva's time, the Baroness. Eva had the whole room decorated in black as a gesture of permanent mourning for her father Valentine (or, according to ribald rumours, to set off her own paleness for her lovers). It was Kitty Mazarine, much later, who freshened the furnishings and made it the Pale Chamber.
