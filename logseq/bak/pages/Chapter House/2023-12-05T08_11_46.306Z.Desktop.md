- Chapter House
- Here the monastic superiors would meet to manage the affairs of St Brandan's and to resolve its disputes. Here in 1349, the last trial of the last nuns of St Brandan's took place. Two were executed for the murder of Abbess Nonna, supposedly with 'perversions of the healing arts'. Nonna was the last abbess of St Brandan's, and after the trial, the monastery never accepted female novices again. From the wide windows, the sea is always visible, beating on the rocks far below.
